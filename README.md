# Form submission demo
## Example of 3 different types of form submission

This demo shows the form input *name* attribute values being
printed to the browser console to illustrate which form attribute 
is responsible for sending form data.

Since the form action attribute value is set to a placeholder value, *#*,
the form values are being printed to the browser console via
JavaScript in the JS folder. (which can be ignored for now)
