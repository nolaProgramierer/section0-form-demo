# Form submission demo
## Example of 3 different types of form submission

This demo shows the form input *name* attribute values being
printed to the browser console to illustrate which form attribute 
is responsible for sending form data.

Since the form action attribute value is set to a placeholder value, *#*,
the form values are being printed to the browser console via
JavaScript in the JS folder. (which can be ignored for now)

Feel free to fork this repo, clone it and run it locally for further reference.
